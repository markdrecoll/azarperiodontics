            What is Gingivitis?
            Gingivitis is a type of gum disease associated with inflammation of the surrounding gum tissue. It occurs from a build-up of plaque (a sticky film of bacteria). Plaque irritates the gums, causing the gums to appear red, puffy, and can bleed. Furthermore, the bacteria found within plaque may effect tooth structure, weakening tooth enamel.
